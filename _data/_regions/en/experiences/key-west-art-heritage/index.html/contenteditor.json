From Ernest Hemingway to Tennessee Williams, some of America’s most significant authors, playwrights and artists have lived here, worked here, or been famously inspired by the island’s natural wonder. And today, Key West remains home to a vibrant community of contemporary artists who ensure that our storied arts and literary history will continue to thrive and evolve.</div><div style=\"\"><br></div><div style=\"\"><h3><b>Architecture</b></h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Conch architecture is the signature style that was born in Key West, and can be found throughout the island. Visitors will immediately recognize the iconic appearance of conch homes that grace postcards: wood and clapboard houses elevated from the ground on posts or piers, many with shingled roofs, low gables, and double-hung sash windows. The style was initially developed in the 18th century by Bahamian immigrants, and has always made perfect sense for Key West’s tropical climate: for instance, raised homes allow for air to circulate under the floor. Today the conch style captures the charming island spirit of the Florida Keys.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Other stately architectural styles flourish in Key West too.
