While it appears to be part of our site, the Booking Engine is in fact provided by a third party and is governed by its privacy practices. We understand that security remains the primary concern of online consumers and have chosen the Booking Engine Vendor carefully.</p><h3>Protecting Your Information</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">We would like our Site visitors to feel confident about using the Site to plan and purchase their accommodations, so Hotel is committed to protecting the information we collect.

The Site servers/systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling, technologies, and industry-standard firewalls. When you enter personal information during the reservation process, or during a customer email sign-up, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission.</p><h3>Withdrawing Consent to Use</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">If, after permitting use of your personal information, you later decide that you no longer want Hotel to include you on its mailing list or otherwise contact you or use your personal information in the manner disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the Site, simply tell us by sending an e-mail, or by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” button at the bottom of our email communication to you.</p></div><h3>Use of Aggregated Data</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Hotel is interested in improving the Site and may develop and offer new features and services. We monitor aggregated data regarding use of the Site for marketing purposes and to study, improve and promote use of the Site. In connection with such purposes, Hotel may share aggregated data with third parties collectively and in an anonymous way. Disclosure of aggregated data does not reveal personal information about individual Site users in any way that identifies who they are or how to contact them.</p><h3>Exceptions to the Privacy Policy</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Hotel has two exceptions to these limits on use of personal information:</p><ul><li>Hotel may monitor and, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required, disclose information to protect the security, property, assets and/or rights of Hotel from unauthorized use, or misuse, of the Site or anything found at the Site.</li><li>Hotel may disclose information when required by law; however, only to the extent necessary and in a manner that seeks to maintain the privacy of the individual.<br></li></ul></div></div></div></div><h3>Use of Cookies</h3></div><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">To enable features at the Site, Hotel may assign one or more \"cookies\" to your Internet browser. Cookies, among other things, speed navigation through our Site, keep track of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and may provide you with customized content. A cookie is an Internet mechanism composed of a small text file containing a unique identification number that permits a web server to send small pieces of information or text by means of your browser and place them on your computer's hard drive for storage. This text lets the web server know if you have previously visited the web page. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">We use cookies to collect and maintain aggregated data (such as the number of visitors) to help us see which areas are most popular with our users and improve and update the content on our site. While in the process of browsing our site, you also provide us with information that doesn't reveal your personal identity -- what type of destination you're exploring, for example. We use this aggregated data only as explained in this Privacy Policy. We do not connect aggregated data to any name, address, or other identifying information.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">You may occasionally receive cookies from unaffiliated companies or organizations, to the extent they place advertising on our Site or are linked to the Site. These third-party cookies may collect information about you when you \"click\" on their advertising or content or link. This practice is standard in the Internet industry. Because of the way in which the Internet operates, we cannot control collection of this information by these third parties, and these cookies are not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p><div style=\"\"><h3>Children's Privacy &amp; Parental Consent</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Please be aware that Hotel has not designed this Site for, and does not intend for it to be used by, anyone under age 18. Accordingly, this Site should not be used by anyone under age 18. Our privacy policy prohibits us from accepting users who are under the age of 18. Hotel specifically requests that persons under the age of 18 not use this Site or submit or post information to the Site. Should Hotel inadvertently acquire personal information or other data from users under the age of 18, Hotel will not knowingly provide this data to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, and any subsequent disclosure would be due to the fact the user under age 18 used the Site and submitted personal information without solicitation by or permission from Hotel.</p><div style=\"\"><h3>Links Provided to Other Sites</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Hotel may provide links to a number of other web sites that we believe might offer you useful information and services. However, those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Hotel. Therefore, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the actions of any third parties, including without limitation, any web site owners whose sites may be reached through this Site, nor can we control the activities of those web sites. We urge you to contact the relevant parties controlling these sites or accessing their on-line policies for the relevant information about their data collection practices before submitting any personal information or other sensitive data.</p><h3>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Use of the Site signifies your consent, as well as the consent of the company for whom you use the Site and whose information you submit (if any), to this on-line Privacy Policy, including the collection and use of information by Hotel, as described in this statement, and also signifies agreement to the terms of use for the Site. Continued access and use of the Site without acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy relieves Hotel from responsibility to the user.</p><h3>Policy Modifications &amp; Contacting Hotel</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 25px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: visible;\">Hotel reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time; notice of changes will be published on this page.
